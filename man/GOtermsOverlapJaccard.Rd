\title{Calculate Jaccard similarity based on GO term overlap}
\usage{
GOtermsOverlapJaccard(GOresults, groupBy, pCutoff = 0.05, topGOnum = 1e+05)
}
\arguments{
\item{GOresults}{GO enrichment results dataframe (from run_GOanalysis)}

\item{groupBy}{Character string specifying grouping column}

\item{pCutoff}{Numeric, adjusted p-value cutoff for GO terms (default: 0.05)}

\item{topGOnum}{Integer, maximum number of top GO terms per group (default: 100000)}
}
\value{
A similarity matrix with Jaccard indices
}
\description{
Computes Jaccard similarity coefficients between groups based on overlap
of enriched GO terms.
}
\details{
This function is useful for comparing functional similarity between
groups based on their enriched biological processes.

go_results <- run_GOanalysis(markers, groupBy = "seurat_clusters",
                              prefix = "MyProject")
